Plan with Krushna is a React project that allows users to explore tours of various Indian cities. The project utilizes React's state management with useState to dynamically display tour information. Tours are passed as props to child components, allowing for efficient rendering and management of tour data. Additionally, the project employs prop functions to handle user interactions, such as marking tours as "Not Interested" and removing them from the list.
